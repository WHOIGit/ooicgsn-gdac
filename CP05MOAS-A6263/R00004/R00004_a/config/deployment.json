The first across-shelf transect was broken into two smaller runs (Runs A and B) because the mission had to be aborted so parameters could be updated. These files are associated with Run A only. The CDOM variable has been corrected for a bias as notified by the vendor. See the CDOM variable comment attribute for more info.",

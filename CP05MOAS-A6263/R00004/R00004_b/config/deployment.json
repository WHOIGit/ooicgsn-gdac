These files are associated with the across-shelf transect. This mission was aborted at approximately 2017-06-10 13:19:00 UTC to correct mission parameters. The mission was resumed at approximately 2017-06-10 14:20:00 UTC. Only data collected after the mission was resumed are ingested. The CDOM variable has been corrected for a bias as notified by the vendor. See the CDOM variable comment attribute for more info.",

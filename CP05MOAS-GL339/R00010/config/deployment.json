The DVL was disabled on 2020-04-17 to conserve battery power. The altimeter began to fail in late April so the glider was restricted to deeper water and the southern portion of the EB line on 2020-05-03. The glider was caught in eddies and blown off course multiple times throughout the deployment. This was a relatively normal deployment.",

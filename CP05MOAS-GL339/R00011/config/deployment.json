Around 2020-07-20 the water density at the array became lower than was anticipated for this time of year and the glider became too dense/heavy for its environment. The glider began experiencing difficulty obtaining and maintaining the surface and eventually dropped its emergency ejection weight on 2020-07-30. It was put in surface drift mode until recovery.",

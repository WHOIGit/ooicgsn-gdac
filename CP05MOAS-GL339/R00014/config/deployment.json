        "comment": "Deployment Notes: This glider was deployed with a slightly modified optode orientation to improve calibration by exposing it to air. The optode mount was moved to a spot slightly forward of the glider's fin and oriented so that the optode would be above the waterline when the glider was at the surface. The optode remained powered and logging during the air surface intervals. Glider spent a significant portion of the deployment off of the EB line due to being swept by WCR currents.",

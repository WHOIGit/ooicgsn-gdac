        "comment": "Deployment Summary: This glider was deployed with a slightly modified optode to improve calibration by exposing it to air. The optode mount was moved to a spot slightly forward of the glider's fin and oriented so that the optode would be above the waterline when the glider was at the surface. The optode remains powered and logging during the air surface intervals. This glider's memory cards filled up partway through the deployment and data had to be deleted in order to continue the deployment. Data records between 5/17/2021 and 6/5/2021 were purged. No recovered data expected for this period but telemetered data are available.",

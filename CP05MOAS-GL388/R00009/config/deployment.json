It was initially deployed to the Frontal Zone 1 (FZ-1) line but exhibited poor steering performance shortly after deployment so it was re-assigned to the Slope Sea 1 (SS-1) line. The glider continued to exhibit poor steering ability throughout the deployment and often overshot waypoints or failed to maintain the SS-1 trackline. The DVL was disabled 2020-02-04 to conserve battery power. Otherwise, this was a relatively normal deployment.",

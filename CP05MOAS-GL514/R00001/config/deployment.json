The DVL was disabled on 2020-04-17, the optode on 2020-05-04 and the remaining sensors on 2020-05-08 to conserve battery power. The glider was restricted to deeper water on the southern portion of the FZ line (SW to SE) after 2020-05-04 to limit pump inflections. This was a relatively normal deployment.",

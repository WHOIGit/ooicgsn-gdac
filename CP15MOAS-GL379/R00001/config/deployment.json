        "comment": "This glider was deployed with a slightly modified optode to improve calibration by exposing it to air. The optode mount was moved to a spot slightly forward of the glider's fin and oriented so that the optode would be above the waterline when the glider was at the surface. The optode is powered and logging during the air surface intervals before starting a dive. The science computer began to malfunction on 2024-04-09 resulting in the interruption of science data logging until 2024-04-10. The computer malfunctioned again on 2024-04-17 and logging stopped again. The glider was recovered on 2024-04-18 for troubleshooting and was not redeployed.",

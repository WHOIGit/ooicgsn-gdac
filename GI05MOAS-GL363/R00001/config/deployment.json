The optode mount was moved to a spot slightly forward of the glider's fin and oriented so that the optode would be above the waterline when the glider was at the surface. The optode remains powered and logging during the air surface intervals after finishing a dive. Additionally, all sensors were changed from descent-only to ascent-only logging to avoid sensor lag artifacts when moving from air to water.",

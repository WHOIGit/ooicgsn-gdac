On 2020-04-21 the glider was commanded to depart the Papa Array and fly toward Oregon to maximize recovery options as the 2020 Station Papa cruise was postponed due to COVID-related concerns. Science sensors continued to sample on the swim to Oregon until 2020-05-29 when they were disabled to preserve battery power for recovery. Conductivity measurements are out of range and suspect from 2019-11-21 through 2019-11-27. We believe that the CTD was fouled during this period but cannot know for sure.",

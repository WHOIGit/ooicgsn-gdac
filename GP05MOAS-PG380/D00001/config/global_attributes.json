    "summary": "The Global component of the OOI includes arrays at critical, yet under-sampled, high-latitude locations such as within the Gulf of Alaska in the Northeast Pacific. The Global Station Papa Array includes two types of gliders that provide simultaneous spatial and temporal sampling capabilities. Open-Ocean Gliders follow track lines around the triangular mooring array and are equipped with acoustic modems to relay data from the Flanking Moorings to shore via satellite telemetry. Profiling Gliders sample the upper water column near the Apex Profiler Mooring."

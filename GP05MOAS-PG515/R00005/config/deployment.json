        "comment": "This glider was deployed with a slightly modified optode to improve calibration by exposing it to air. The optode mount was moved to a spot slightly forward of the glider's fin and oriented so that the optode would be above the waterline when the glider was at the surface. The optode remains powered and logging during the air surface intervals. Chlorophyll measurements were periodically negative throughout this deployment. The Optode was disabled 2024-03-13 to conserver battery power. No oxygen data expected after this date. All remaining science sensors were disabled 2024-04-23 to conserve battery power. No science data expected after this date.",
